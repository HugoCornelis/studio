    <h1>Integration Tests for the Studio</h1>

    Below you find all the test specifications for the Neurospaces
    Studio.  The tests consist mainly of queries to the
    model-container using the studio scripting interface.  The GUI is
    to a large extent self-configuring, such that adaptations to the
    Neurospaces middle-ware automatically propagate to the GUI.  There
    are currently no GUI regression tests.

    <p>

      These tests should give a broad idea of how to query Neurospaces
      to obtain useful information from a model in the model library.
