    <h1>Integration Tests for the Studio</h1>

    Below you find all the test specifications for the Neurospaces
    Studio.  The tests consist mainly of queries to Neurospaces.  The
    GUI is not tested (to much work for now).  On the other hand, the
    GUI is for a large part self-configuring, such that adaptations to
    the Neurospaces middle-ware propagate to the GUI.

    <p>

      These tests should give a broad idea of how to query Neurospaces
      to obtain useful information from a model in the model library.
