This is package is the result of an architecture refactoring of the
neurospaces package.

For installation, refer to the neurospaces HOWTO.outline document.
Most perl packages mentioned overthere are not needed for neurospaces,
but for are needed for using the studio package.

- Packaging fixes.
- Added project support.
- Added glue for the morphology structure analyzer.
- Added support for color coding of morphologies.
- Added support for setting the D3 camera view per morphology.
- Start using Data::Utilities from CPAN (so you need that module installed).
- Allowed the Neurospaces studio to be used as a simulation call for
  SSP, use Neurospaces::GUI::gui() as simulation routine.
